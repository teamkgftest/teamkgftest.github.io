Entry 1:

Today, the 21st of March 2023 is the day I've run final tests (Thank you Unknown Tester) on 
the test website and scheduled the real site to go live. That marks the end of my contribution 
to the yearbook team as well.

We decided to make an yearbook despite it being against public opinion (ahem, 11th SC) and I'm 
happy we decided to do so.

Despite what I say all the time, the past 4 months have been great and it couldn't have been any 
better. From the random google meets to discuss the yearbook to playing "matchmaker" for some 
people, this GC has truly been a great thing.

With that comes the end of my emotional farewell (it's fine you can stop crying). Every moment 
all the way back from when we were brainstorming ideas in december to pushing the commit for the 
website to go live a few minutes ago has been a great experience and I'm proud to have been a 
member of KGF (earlier known as KCG).
